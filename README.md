Monsteropolis is a fabulous destination for all who have riches or wish to become rich. Come for a stage show, play in the casino, visit the markets. Located in Northern Faerun, just a short boat ride from Mirabar.

Monsteropolis was founded by great, bugbear warlord Gorehunger the Impaler, friend of the dwarves, annihilator of the hill giants, his swashbuckling brother Gregek, navigator of the skies, and their boon companion Sloop the Bone Harvester, of the lizard folk, paramount of the bone carvers.

This resort was imagined by a Ben, Ryan, Andrew and Dan, a Dungeons and Dragons adventuring group while attempting to save the world from the wrath of the giants.
